DNDBuilder is a project to build Dungeons and Dragons characters for 5th edition and maintain items, spells, and combat.
It is a hobby project at this time. I currently have no plans of monitization. I am unfamiliar with how open-source licensing works, so no license is currently provided to protect copyright.

Hard-coded values for attributes and skills will be removed in future versions, as the full scope of the project is to provide the ability to use the program with compatible d20/5th edition rulesets

Massive help from github.com/tsaglam/Carcassonne as an example for control/model/view and file structures.
